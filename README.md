# Renew_letsencrypt_certs
As [Let's Encrypt](http://letsencrypt.org) scripts currently only support Ubuntu 14.04+, I'm sort of stuck on 12.04, and I needed to have the [Plesk](http://odin.com/products/plesk) (version 11) certificates updated I wrote this script to serve my needs.

## Setup

Rename `renew_letsencrypt_certs.sample.log` to `renew_letsencrypt_certs.log` and follow examples/description within.

## Licence

This script is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
